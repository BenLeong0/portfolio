## Note

A lot of inspiration was taken from Matthew Williams' portfolio, hosted at http://findmatthew.com/. While the influence is certainly obvious, I would like to note that the style and layout was something that I had already decided on, and Matthew's portfolio happened to fit many if not all of the ideas I had already come up with. These include the title page, how the projects are laid out, and even the font (Raleway) I had already decided on before finding Matthew's. As such, Matthew's portfolio was largely used more as a stencil to avoid the trial-and-error process of finding ideal sizes etc.
